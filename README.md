Disease Prediction Based on User Symptoms
This Python script allows users to input their current symptoms and predicts the most likely disease based on predefined symptom sets. It is a simple rule-based health assistant meant for educational or demonstration purposes.

Features
Accepts user input for symptoms over multiple attempts

Matches symptoms with predefined disease profiles

Identifies the most probable disease if at least two symptoms match

Provides basic first-aid tips and a recommendation to consult a medical specialist

Includes symptom sets for the following diseases:

Malaria

Dengue

Flu

COVID-19

Typhoid

How It Works
The user is prompted up to 3 times to enter symptoms (comma-separated).

The input symptoms are matched against stored symptom lists for each disease.

If at least 2 symptoms match a disease profile, a likely diagnosis is printed.

If no match is found, the script advises consulting a doctor.
